# ATS Teamified - Repository Template

## Overview
This is a cross-platform development environment setup template for new projects. It provides automated setup scripts for configuring development tools and environments across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Project Type
**Development Tooling & Documentation** - This is not a traditional web application but rather a collection of setup scripts and documentation for streamlining development environment configuration.

## Key Features
- Cross-platform setup scripts (Python, PowerShell, Bash)
- Automated installation of development tools (Git, VS Code, Docker, Node.js, Python, Playwright, Postman)
- Pre-configured code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, Pylint, Black)
- Comprehensive documentation and coding standards
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows

## Architecture
- **template-setup/**: Platform-specific setup scripts
  - `setup.py`: Cross-platform Python setup script
  - `setup-windows.ps1`: Windows PowerShell script
  - `setup-macos.sh`: macOS Bash script
  - `setup-linux.sh`: Linux Bash script
- **docs/**: Project documentation, coding standards, style guides
- **src/**: Empty directory for future application code
- **tests/**: Test directory structure

## Recent Changes
- 2025-11-13: Initial repository setup with template structure
- 2025-11-13: Imported to Replit environment

## Replit Setup
Since this is a template repository rather than a runnable application, we've set up:
- A simple HTTP server to serve documentation
- Easy access to view setup scripts and documentation
