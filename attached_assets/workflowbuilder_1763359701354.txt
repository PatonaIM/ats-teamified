⭐ Summary

Yes — each stage becomes a mini-configuration block with:

▶ Stage Info
▶ Interview / Assessment Settings
▶ Automations
▶ Approvals & Validation
▶ Notifications
▶ Integrations

This makes your ATS workflow builder enterprise-grade, like Greenhouse and Workday.

If you want, I can now also create:

✅ Stage schema (database tables)
✅ JSON structure for stage configurations
✅ UI wireframe for stage settings panel

Just tell me: "Create stage DB schema" or "Show UI wireframe".
